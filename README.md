# DFT and Magnitude-Phase Dominance


Implement 2D DFT using row-column decomposition. Compute DFT’s 𝑭𝟏
(𝒌,𝒍) = |𝑭𝟏(𝒌,𝒍)|𝒆𝒋ɵ𝟏(𝒌,𝒍) and 𝑭𝟐(𝒌,𝒍) = |𝑭𝟐(𝒌,𝒍)|𝒆𝒋ɵ𝟐(𝒌,𝒍) of 𝑰𝟏(fourier.png) and 𝑰𝟐 (fourier_transform.png) respectively. Arrive at two new images 𝑰𝟑 and 𝑰𝟒 such that their DFTs are, respectively, 𝑭𝟑(𝒌,𝒍) = |𝑭𝟏(𝒌,𝒍)|𝒆𝒋ɵ𝟐(𝒌,𝒍) and 𝑭𝟒(𝒌,𝒍) =|𝑭𝟐(𝒌,𝒍)|𝒆𝒋ɵ𝟏(𝒌,𝒍)
